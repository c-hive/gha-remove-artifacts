# JavaScript Boilerplate

#### A boilerplate that sets the grounds for any kind of JS development. More generic things, less specific things.

It has
- formatting
- linting
- editor options
- pre-commit hook
- gitignore
- [~~npmignore~~ npm files](https://github.com/c-hive/guides/blob/2d3e41b73515a571dd78576e02d2fd15fe786d9e/js/package.md#what-to-include)
- [dependency comments](https://github.com/c-hive/guides/blob/2d3e41b73515a571dd78576e02d2fd15fe786d9e/js/best-practices.md#comment-dependencies-in-the-packagejson)
- dependency security fixes
- npm version requirement [to avoid `package-lock` ping-pong](https://github.com/c-hive/guides/blob/24ce093e59f89374ed2bf0a2e1fc5c45e5490044/js/best-practices.md#specify-npm-version-requirements-to-avoid-package-lock-ping-pong)
