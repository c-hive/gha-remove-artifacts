#### GitHub Action to customize artifact cleanup

Status and support

- &#x2714; stable
- &#x2714; supported
- &#x2716; no ongoing development

[![CI](/../../workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](/../../actions)

GitHub Action Artifacts are removed after [90 days](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Managing-Actions-storage-space/m-p/41424/highlight/true#M4618) by default. [GitHub now supports changing this setting](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-08-github-actions-ability-to-change-retention-days-for-artifacts-and-logs/). This action allows you to further customize the cleanup. It
- removes artifacts that are older than the specified age
- has the option to keep release (tagged) artifacts
- has the option to keep a number of recent artifacts
- [respects](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-throttling.js) GitHub's rate limit

Example use cases:
- keep all release artifacts for a year, remove non-release artifacts after 30 days
- keep the most recent 10 artifacts
